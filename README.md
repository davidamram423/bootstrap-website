# bootstrap-website

Creating a website using tools mainly from bootstrap

This project was conducted as a project for a course I am taking online in order to further my knowledge of programming using various languages.

At this stage in my learning, I have already completed HTML and CSS, with heavy concentration on flexbox, grids and bootstrap.
