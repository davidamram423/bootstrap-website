Creating a website using tools from bootstrap

This website is simply a dating website for dogs. This project has been created without the use of Javascript, so there wont be
any specific functionalities. The purpose was to practice my skills using HTML and CSS with tools from bootstrap.

This project was conducted as a project for a course I am taking online in order to further my knowledge of programming using various languages.

At this stage in my learning, I have already completed HTML and CSS, with heavy concentration on flexbox, grids and bootstrap.
